# map-editor
A small map editor project I made in haskell to compete with a friend. It features parsing, dynamic array resizing using `massiv`, TUI, vim-like commands, and light weight resource usage.
Completed in its current state during my junior year in highschool. It isn't technically complete, but it was never meant to be actually used. I moreso wanted to make something more functional than whatever my friend was making, and this is what I came up with.
